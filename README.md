This project analyzes the pitching performance of Shohei Ohtani during the 2022 and 2023 MLB seasons. The analysis includes visualizations of Ohtani's pitches, strikeouts, and pitch distribution.

Shohei Ohtani's journey in Major League Baseball has been nothing short of extraordinary. Known for his dual-threat capabilities as both a hitter and a pitcher, Ohtani's growth as a pitcher from 2022 to 2023 offers a captivating narrative of adaptability, innovation, and strategic brilliance. His evolution goes beyond just the numbers; it signifies a calculated transformation to maximize his impact on the game while preserving his unique dual-role status.
Arsenal Changes
In 2022, Ohtani's pitching repertoire was a testament to versatility. His pitch distribution reflected a willingness to keep hitters off balance, constantly evolving and adapting to the ever-changing dynamics of a Major League Baseball game. The numbers told the story: his sweeping curveball, known as the sweeper, led the charge at 37%. This was followed by the four-seam fastball at 27%, and the splitter at 12%. His repertoire also included the curveball, cutter, sinker, and even the slow curve, each with its unique purpose.
As the 2023 season began, it became evident that Ohtani was not going to maintain the status quo. His pitch distribution underwent a calculated transformation, signaling a deliberate strategy. 
In 2023, the pitch distribution evolved significantly. The sweeper remained a pivotal part of his repertoire but saw a slight decrease to 35%. What was most striking was the emergence of the four-seam fastball as his primary pitch, with a remarkable 33% usage rate. In addition to the four-seamer, Ohtani introduced the cutter as a new weapon, accounting for 16% of his pitch distribution. The sinker and splitter, while still present, each had a 6% share, emphasizing a decrease in reliance on these pitches. The curveball, though not a major part of his repertoire in either year, saw a slight decrease from 8% in 2022 to 4% in 2023.
Why Abandon The Split?
The question that arises from these changes is, why? What motivated Ohtani to adjust his pitch selection and evolve his pitching strategy in such a calculated manner? One potential reason could be a proactive approach to minimize the long-term impact on his arm health. The splitter in particular is known for its taxing mechanics, which might have led Ohtani to reevaluate its role in his repertoire. By reducing its usage and incorporating the cutter, he could effectively challenge hitters while potentially reducing the strain on his arm over the course of a grueling season.
The introduction of the cutter as a prominent pitch in 2023 also speaks to Ohtani's commitment to expanding his arsenal. The cutter adds a new layer of complexity to his game, with late horizontal movement that can disrupt hitters' timing and provide a different look. Ohtani's willingness to incorporate this pitch signifies his desire to keep hitters guessing and to continually refine his craft.

Strikeout Distribution
Now, as we delve deeper into Ohtani's evolution, we must also consider his strikeout distribution. Striking out batters is a pivotal aspect of pitching, as it demonstrates a pitcher's effectiveness and command of different pitches. In 2022, Ohtani's approach to striking out batters varied when facing right-handed and left-handed hitters.
Against right-handed batters, his number one put-away pitch was the sweeper, followed closely by the splitter and the four-seam fastball. This distribution showcased his ability to conquer right-handed hitters with a mix of breaking balls and high-velocity fastballs. However, when facing left-handed batters, Ohtani's dominant put-away pitch was the splitter, followed by the sweeper. The splitter's late downward movement made it particularly effective against lefties, complemented by the sweeping curveball.
The striking change occurred in 2023 when Ohtani's strikeout distribution exhibited a more uniform pattern. The sweeper emerged as the primary put-away pitch against both right-handed and left-handed batters, highlighting his growing confidence in this pitch. The four-seam fastball, with its newfound prominence, followed as a potent strikeout weapon. This shift represented a calculated approach to striking out batters from both sides of the plate, emphasizing versatility and adaptability.
